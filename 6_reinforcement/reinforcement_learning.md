# Reinforcement Learning Intro

Reinforcement Learning is
- a branch of ML 
- also called online learning
- used to solve interacting problems/real-time problems
- use data accumulated until time `t` to decide what action to take at time `t+1`.
- Desired outcomes provide the algorithm with a **reward**.
- Undesirable outcomes provide the algo with a **punishment**.
- Algos adjust their own parameters through trial and error while to maximise reward.

Two kinds of reinforcement learning that we will cover in this course
1. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
2. Thompson Sampling
