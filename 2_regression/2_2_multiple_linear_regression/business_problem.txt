BUSINESS PROBLEM - MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

- The dataset is called "50 Startups"
- We have venture capitalist funding data for 50 real-world startups.
- The data consists of profit, loss, and expenditure for each startup.
- Expenditure classified into admin, marketing spending, R&D.
- Also have the state: a categorical variable. 
- The target variable is the profit: given a set of expenditure data and 
the state in which a startup is based, we want to predict the profit/loss
for that startup.
- Business Value: the venture capital firm can use our model to predict the 
expected profit for a new startup and then decide whether or not it is worth financing.
- We want to find the relationship between profit and MULTIPLE expenditure classes.
