SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
- Formula is y = b0 + b1 * x1
	- y: the dependent variable, value depends on the variation of another variable
		- salary's variation with years of experience
		- student's grade with time spent on studying
	- x1: the independent variable
		- may directly or indirectly affect the value of the dependent variable
	- b1: how a unit change in the independent variable affects the value of y
	It is a parameter that connects the independent variable's change to the that
	of the dependent variable
	- b0: another parameter, but this is an intercept. The value of the dependent
	variable in the absence of any independent factors.


EXAMPLE 1 - OUR BUSINESS PROBLEM
In our case, the model is 
	Salary = b0 + b1 * Experience

This is a line that best fits/approximates our experience/salary data. 
- b0 is the y intercept: the point where the line crosses the vertical axis.
This is the salary for a new employee or employee with 0 years of experience.
This is the base salary: the minimum salary that will be offered to a new employee.
-b1 is the slope of the line: the steeper the line, the greater the increase in 
salary for every additional year of experience. 


LINE OF BEST FIT
- How to find the trendline/line of best fit?
- Residuals: the difference between the actual and predicted salaries for a given
value of years of experience.
- We find the line that minimise the square of sum of residuals: minimise (y - y')^2
- This means we need to find the values of b0 an b1 which does this.
- This is called ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES.
