Business Problem
- Two columns in our dataset: years of experience and salaries for employees
- We've been hired to find if a correlation exists between years of experience and salary
- Want to quantify the extent to which years of experience should be renumerated 
- Maybe they just have a rough set of guidelines for assigning salaries and want
us to derive a model.
- Business value
	- if the company doesn't have a set of rules to set salaries, they
	can use this model i.e. if this is how you've been setting salaries so far, this 
	model will tell you how to assign them a new salary that is consistent with your
	hiring practicies
	- what if the company receives an employee with 20/30 years experience:
	unprecedented. Model will help them decide how to pay.
