INTEPRETING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS

SIGN
- If the sign of the coefficient is positive, the associated independent variable
is positively correlated with the dependent variable. 
- E.g. increasing this variable will increase the dependent variable, and decreasing
the independent variable will decrease the dependent variable.
- If the sign is -ive, then the two are antagonistically related: increasing the 
independent variable decreases the dependent variable.

MAGNITUDE
- Trickier than sign, not as straightforward.
- This is because units of the independent variable are also involved.
- E.g. if marketing expenditure is 100 while R.D Expenditure is 12, the knee-jerk
reaction would be to assume marketing expenditure has a greater impact on the dependent
variable than the R.D expenditure.
- However, what if marketing expenditure was defined in terms of cents and R.D expenditure 
in terms of 1000s of dollars? 
- This would mean that a per unit increase in R.D expenditure would result in a 12000 
dollar increase in sales, whereas a similar per unit expenditure in marketing expenditure
would only lead to 100 cent increase in sales.
- The increases are based on the assumption that all other variables are kept constant.
