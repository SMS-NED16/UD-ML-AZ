POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION

So far we've discussed simple and multiple linear regression. A third type is polynomial 
regression.

Polynomial regression model looks like this
y = b0 + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x1^2) + ... + (bn * x1^n)

The power of the independent variable changes from 1 to n. So this is no longer a linear
function. It is a non-linear or polynomial function.

If the data is roughly linear, we can use simple linear regression. But if the data is 
non linear (parabolic, cubic, etc.) we can't use a linear model - it won't fit the data
well. We need to use a non-linear function of the same independent variable to account
for the non-linearity in the data e.g y = b0 + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x1^2)

Poly regressions are used to describe how diseases spread across populations.

WHY IS IT STILL CALLED A LINEAR MODEL (POLYNOMIAL LINEAR REGRESSION)?
The linear in the name of the model does not refer to the independent variable. It refers
to the parameters or coefficients. Whether or not the function is non-linear in terms of 
the independent variable, what matters is if the function can be expressed as a linear
combination of the coefficients/parameters.

Even in y = b0 + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x1^2) + ... + (bn * x1^n), the coefficients
b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are still raised to the first pwoer. So the output is till a linear
combination of the input features, even if these features are non-linear.

A NON-LINEAR polynomial regression model would look like
y = b0 + (b1^2 * x1) + (b2^# * x1^2) + ... + (bn^m* x1^n)
