# Convolutional Neural Networks - Overview

1. What are Convolutional Neural Networks (features, examples, brain vs CNNs for image recognition)
2. Individual Steps in CNN Problem Workflow
	1. Convolution Operation
	2. ReLU Layer: why linearity is not good, why non-lineary is better for image recognition.
	3. Pooling: what is pooling + max, mean, sum and other approaches + example
	4. Flattening: proceeding from pooled layers to flattened layers.
	5. Full Connection: puts everything together and shows how final neurons understand images.
3. Summary
4. **Optional**: Softmax and Cross-Entropy
