# Business Problem - ANN

- Our dataset contains fictional data of 10k bank customers. The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates i.e. customers that are leaving the bank at unusually high rates. 
- We have to use this dataset to give the bank some insights about why this might be happening.
- 10k is a tiny sample of the total client base of this bank. 
- The bank recorded a variety of features about each customer e.g. `tenure`, whether they logged into online banking, estimated salary, whether the member has a credit card, bank balance etc.
- The bank observed these customers for 6 months, recording this data, and then record if the person left the bank at any point during these 6 months.
- Our goal: to develop a **geo-demographic segmentation** model that predicts which customer is at the highest risk of leaving the bank.
- Geodemographic models are highly valuable for any customer-centric organization, and not just for this purpose.
	- E.g. giving loans to a particular customer.
	- Finding out which transactions are likely to be fradulent.
- The model doesn't even have to be geodemographic. As long as it has a binary outcome and lots of different variables, we can use the principles in this tutorial to develop a model that will add value to any organisation.
- Kirill says he has done this IRL multiple times.
